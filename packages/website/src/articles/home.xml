        <p>
            Gaclib is a GPU accelerated C++ User Interface library.
            It is flexible, customizable with rich amount of built-in layout and controls.
            It also supports control templates, list item templates, MVVM, localization, animation, etc.
            More importantly, even if the UI is very complex, it still has good performance in interaction.
            You can find it at <a href="https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release">github</a>.
            This library provide many useful features.
            If you don't need all features,
            you can just use a subset of released C++ files to reduce the size of the executable.
