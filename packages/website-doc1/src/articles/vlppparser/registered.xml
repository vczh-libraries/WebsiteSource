        <title>Registered Types</title>
        <p>
            Reflectable C++ types under some C++ namespaces are usually registered with other names in other namespaces.
            Here are all types in this library that are registered.

        <p>
            When <b>VCZH_DEBUG_NO_REFLECTION</b> is on, types will not be registered.
