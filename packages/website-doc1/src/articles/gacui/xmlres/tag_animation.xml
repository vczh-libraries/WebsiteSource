            After a <b>GacUI XML Resource</b> is converted to a resource binary:
            <ul>
                <li>This resource does not exist in the resource binary.</li>
                <li>The equivalent Workflow script will be included in the Workflow assembly part in the resource binary.</li>
                <li>
                    If you use the one specified in <b>GacGenConfig/Cpp</b>,
                    the Workflow assembly is also not included in the resource binary,
                    because you are supposed to use the generated C++ code.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
