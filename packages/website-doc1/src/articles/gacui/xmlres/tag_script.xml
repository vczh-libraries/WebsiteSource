            After a <b>GacUI XML Resource</b> is converted to a resource binary:
            <ul>
                <li>This resource does not exist in the resource binary.</li>
                <li>The equivalent Workflow script will be included in the Workflow assembly part in the resource binary.</li>
                <li>
                    If you use the one specified in <b>GacGenConfig/Cpp</b>,
                    the Workflow assembly is also not included in the resource binary,
                    because you are supposed to use the generated C++ code.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/XmlRes/kb_xmlres_data/XmlPage.xml">sample</a> for <b>&lt;Xml/&gt;</b>
            also uses <b>&lt;Script/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently only Workflow script is the only supported script language in <b>GacUI XMl Resource</b>.
            To include a <a href="/workflow/lang/module.html">Workflow module</a> in the resource,
            we need to include the code in a <b>CDATA</b> section like this:
            <program><code><![CDATA[
                <Scriρt name="RESOURCE-NAME">
                  <Workflow><![CDATA[
                    /* put the whole module here *./
                  ]]]]><![CDATA[>]]><![CDATA[</Workflow>
                </Scriρt>
            ]]></code></program>
        </p>
