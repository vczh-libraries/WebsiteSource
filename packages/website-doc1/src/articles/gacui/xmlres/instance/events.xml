        <title>Events</title>
        <p>
            There are two ways to handle an event:
            <program><code><![CDATA[
                <Object ev.EVENT1="FUNCTION_NAME">
                    <ev.EVENT2>FUNCTION_NAME</ev.EVENT2>
                </Object>
            ]]></code></program>
            Or using data binding:
            <program><code><![CDATA[
                <Object ev.EVENT1-eval="{ ... }">
                    <ev.EVENT2-eval><![CDATA[
                        { ... }
                    ]]<![CDATA[>]]><![CDATA[</ev.EVENT2-eval>
                </Object>
            ]]></code></program>
        </p>

            <title>By Function</title>
            <p>
                If a function name is assigned to an event,
                an empty C++ function will be generated.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are recommended to use <b>ref.CodeBehind="true"</b> on the <b>&lt;Instance/&gt;</b>.
                By doing this,
                you will get a separated pair of C++ files for this <b>&lt;Instance/&gt;</b>.
                In the cpp file you will see an very obvious place holder for <b>FUNCTION_NAME</b>.
                You can insert anything you want inside this function.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you change the XML later,
                <b>GacBuild.ps1</b> will recognize your change and merge new generated code with your change.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Only changing code in expected places,
                        which will be marked using obvious comments in generated C++ code.
                        Changing to all other places will be lost after running <b>GacBuild.ps1</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GacBuild.ps1</b> expects "{" and "}" to take the whole line.
                        <b>DO NOT</b> put "{" after the previous line.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <title>By Workflow Statement</title>
            <p>
                <b>-eval</b> must be used if a <a href="/workflow/lang/stat.html">Workflow statement</a> is assigned to an event.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the event is assigned using a tag,
                <b>&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;</b> is required to contain the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use a block statement if multiple statements need to be executed for this event.
