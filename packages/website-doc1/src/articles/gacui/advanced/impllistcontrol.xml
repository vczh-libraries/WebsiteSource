        <title>Creating New List Controls</title>
        <p>
            Customizing <b>GuiTextList</b> or <b>GuiBindableTextList</b> by providing new item templates ,
            should be the most common way to create a new list control experience.
            But you could still create your new list control.
        </p>
        <p>
            In GacUI 1.0,
            any new classes created completely by C++
            (instead of by <b>&lt;Instance/&gt;</b> in GacUI XML Resource)
            is not accessible in the GacUI XML Resource,
            because the compiler doesn't know about that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any new list control is expected to derives from <b>GuiSelectableListControl</b> directly.
            If list items are not selectable,
            then <b>GuiListControl</b> could be used to reduce runtime overhead.
        </p>
        <topic>
            <title>GuiListControl::IItemProvider, the constructor argument</title>
            <p>
                An instance of <b>IItemProvider</b> is required in the constructor of
                <b>GuiListControl</b> and <b>GuiSelectableListControl</b>.
                The base class doesn't control the life cycle of this instance,
                it should be properly disposed in the derived class.
            </p>
            <p>
                This interface offers a bridge so that <b>GuiListControl</b> could access its items.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>AttachCallback</b>:
                        Multiple <b>IItemProviderCallback</b> could be installed to an <b>IItemProvider</b>.
                        When a callback is properly installed,
                        its <b>OnAttached(this)</b> must be called immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>DetachCallback</b>:
                        This method is called to remove an installed <b>IItemProviderCallback</b>.
                        When a callback is properly uninstalled,
                        its <b>OnAttached(nullptr)</b> must be called immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PushEditing</b>:
                        This method is called when the list control enters another level of editing mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PopEditing</b>:
                        This method is called when the list control leaves one level of editing mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>IsEditing</b>:
                        This method should return <b>true</b> if at least one level of editing mode is still in the list control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Count</b>:
                        This method should return the total number of items in the list control.
                        In <b>GuiTreeView</b>,
                        all collapsed items are not counted.
                        Although they exist in the logical tree,
                        but if a node is collapsed,
                        all sub items will be treated as removed by calling <b>IItemProviderCallback::OnItemModified</b>.
                        And when a node is expanded,
                        all sub items come back in the same way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GetTextValue</b>:
                        This method should return a text representation for a given item.
                        The value will be copied to the <b>Text</b> property of a item template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GetBindingValue</b>:
                        This method should return a <b>non-null</b> object for a given item,
                        if data binding for item source is available in this control.
                        For non-bindable list controls,
                        a <b>null</b> object should be returned by calling the constructor of the return value with no argument,
                        for example, <b>{}</b> in C++.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>RequestView</b>:
                        This method provides a way to decouple between the list control and the details of items.
                        <b>IItemProvider</b> should handle the life cycle of all returned views.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>list::ItemProviderBase</b> could be used to create an <b>IItemProvider</b>.
                The following methods are implemented in this class:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>AttachCallback</b></li>
                    <li><b>DetachCallback</b></li>
                    <li><b>PushEditing</b></li>
                    <li><b>PopEditing</b></li>
                    <li><b>IsEditing</b></li>
                </ul>
                You need to implement the rest to complete an <b>IItemProvider</b>.
                The <b>InvokeOnItemModified</b> method is provider to call <b>OnItemModified</b> in all installed callbacks.

            <title>GuiListControl::IItemProviderCallback, the constructor argument</title>
            <p>
                The <b>OnItemModified</b> allow <b>IItemProvider</b> to report
                one change of consecutive items:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>start</b>: The index of the first item in all changing consecutive items.</li>
                    <li><b>count</b>: The numbers of all changing consecutive items.</li>
                    <li><b>newCount</b>: The numbers of new items that all changing consecutive items change into.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If changes happens in multiple groups of consecutive items,
                each group should be reported in separate call to <b>OnItemModified</b>.
                You must try your best to ensure that,
                <b>IItemProvider::Count</b>,
                <b>IItemProvider::GetTextValue</b>,
                <b>IItemProvider::GetBindingValue</b>
                and all related methods in views from <b>RequestView</b>
                should not see any unreported changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call <b>OnItemModified(start, 0, count)</b>
                when a group of items are inserted to the position <b>start</b>.
                If one item is inserted,
                <b>count</b> should be <b>1</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call <b>OnItemModified(start, count, 0)</b>
                when a group of items are removed from the position <b>start</b>.
                If one item is removed,
                <b>count</b> should be <b>1</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call <b>OnItemModified(start, count, count)</b>
                when a group of items are updated beginning from the position <b>start</b>.
                If one item is updated,
                <b>count</b> should be <b>1</b>.
                An item is updated,
                if the item is replaced,
                or any interested content inside this item is updated.

            <p>
                <b>IItemArranger</b> handles rendering of list items.
                An <b>IItemArranger</b> is attached to a list control
                using its <b>Arranger</b> property
                or its protected method <b>SetStyleAndArranger</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are already some

                    built-in IItemArranger implementations
                </a>.
                Check them out to see if any of the works,
                so you don't have to implement this interface.
                It is pretty difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IItemProviderCallback</b> is also the base class of <b>IItemArranger</b>.
                When an <b>IItemArranger</b> is attached to a list control,
                it will be installed as a callback to <b>IItemProvider</b>.
                So that <b>IItemArranger</b> could update the rendering when any item is changed.

                Here are all methods to implemement:

                    <li>
                        <b>AttachListControl</b>:

                        Only one callback will be installed to <b>IItemArranger</b>.
                        This callback provides everything that an <b>IItemArranger</b> could do the a list control.

                            This is a <b>virtual size</b>,
                            it will be translated by
