        <title>Creating New List Controls</title>
        <p>
            Customizing <b>GuiTextList</b> or <b>GuiBindableTextList</b> by providing new item templates ,
            should be the most common way to create a new list control experience.
            But you could still create your new list control.
        </p>
        <p>
            In GacUI 1.0,
            any new classes created completely by C++
            (instead of by <b>&lt;Instance/&gt;</b> in GacUI XML Resource)
            is not accessible in the GacUI XML Resource,
            because the compiler doesn't know about that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any new list control is expected to derives from <b>GuiSelectableListControl</b> directly.
            If list items are not selectable,
            then <b>GuiListControl</b> could be used to reduce runtime overhead.
