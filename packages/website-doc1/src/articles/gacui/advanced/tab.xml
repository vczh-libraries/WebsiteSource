        <title>TAB and Control Focus</title>
        <p>
            If a focusable control is put on a window,
            by setting the
            <a href="/gacui/components/controls/basic/home.html#TabPriority">
                <b>TabPriority</b>
            </a>
            property to a value that is not <b>-1</b>,
            then it could get focused by pressing <b>TAB</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing <b>TAB</b> switches the focus between different controls in a window,
            in the order of their <b>TabPriority</b> from less to greater,
            when both <b>IsTabEnabled</b> and <b>IsTabAvailable</b> return <b>true</b>.
            If the value is less than <b>-1</b>,
            then they will be treated as <b>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</b>.
            The order between controls with the same <b>TabPriority</b> is undefined.

            <title>Behavior after being Focused</title>
            <p>
                A focusable control will just get focused if <b>TAB</b> decides to give the focus to this control.

            <p>
                If a new control class is created,
                there are multiple ways to customize the behavior
                about how a control should react to <b>TAB</b>:

                <title>Using IGuiTabAction</title>
                <p>
                    <b>IGuiTabAction</b> is a protected base class of all controls.
                    If a new control is created,
                    methods could be overriden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>IsTabEnabled</b> returns <b>true</b> if the control is visible and enabled.
                    <b>IsTabAvailable</b> returns <b>true</b> if the control is focusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default value from <b>GetAcceptTabInput</b> is <b>false</b>.
                    But a few controls like text controls or document controls set this value to <b>true</b>.
                    When <b>GetAcceptTabInput</b> is <b>true</b>,
                    it means this control defines the behavior for this key,
                    like entering a <b>TAB</b> character,
                    so that it doesn't want the focus to be switched to another control.
                    Calling <b>SetAcceptTabInput</b> could change this value.
