  <introduction>
    <p>
      This control template contains common properties for all controls.
      Some controls which don't accept user interaction,
      like group box or different splitters,
      use this class as their control template classes directly.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <inputs>
    <prop name="Focused">
      <p>
        When the control gets its focus, this property is set to <b>true</b>.
        When the control loses its focus, this property is set to <b>false</b>.
      </p>
    </prop>

    <prop name="FocusableComposition">
      <p>
        When a control template is applied to a control,
        if this control accepts focus,
        this property will be assigned,
        indicating the composition that accepts user inputs,
        especially keyboard events.
      </p>
    </prop>
  </inputs>
  <outputs>
    <prop name="ContainerComposition">
      <p>
        Assign a composition to this property in the contructor of a control template,
        and it will become the container for child controls.
        If this composition is not assigned,
        or it is assigned later when the control template is applied to a control,
        then the container composition becomes the control template itself.
