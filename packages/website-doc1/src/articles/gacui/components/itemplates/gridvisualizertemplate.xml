                <p>
                    This property is assigned by the list control.
                    It comes from the <b>PrimaryTextColor</b> property of <b>&lt;ListViewTemplate/&gt;</b> that applied to the list control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list control does not track the changing of the <b>PrimaryTextColor</b> property of <b>&lt;ListViewTemplate/&gt;</b>.
                    If it is changed,
                    <b>PrimaryTextColor</b> of item templates are not changed automatically.
                    But when a list control is assigned with a new control template,
                    <b>PrimaryTextColor</b> of item templates will be updated as well.

                    When the cell is selected,

                    This property is assigned by the item template.
                    It is derives from <b>&lt;ControlTemplate/&gt;</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property is very important.
                    When an embedded visualizer is put inside this visualizer,
                    it is added to the <b>ContainerComposition</b> property of this visualizer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case,
                    if this property is not assigned during construction,
                    it will crash.
