        <title>Grouping Multiple &lt;ToolstripButton&gt;</title>
        <p>
            Unlike toolstrip controls,
            there is no need to add nested grouping in ribbon.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;RibbonButtons/&gt;</b> makes every three buttons in one group but without a splitters.
            splitters could be provided by <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;RibbonToolstrips/&gt;</b> requires buttons to be in groups.
            But since the area is limited,
            you are not expected to put too many buttons in one <b>&lt;RibbonToolstrips/&gt;</b>.
            Multiple <b>&lt;RibbonToolstrips/&gt;</b> could be separated by <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;RibbonSplitter/&gt;</b> could be added in <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b>
            if really needed.
