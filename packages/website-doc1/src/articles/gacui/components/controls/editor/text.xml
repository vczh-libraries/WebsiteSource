                <b>CanPaste</b> also checks the content from the clipboard and see if it is a valid document fragment.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a piece of document is cut or copied,
                following formats are written to the clipboard:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plain text of the document. In Windows, both ANSI and UNICODE formats are available.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Acceptable content from the clipboard is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plain text of the document. In Windows, both ANSI and UNICODE formats are acceptable.</li>
