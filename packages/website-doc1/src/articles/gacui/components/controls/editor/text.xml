            <title>Caret Position</title>
            <p>
                <b>(vl::)presentation::TextPos</b> struct represents a caret position in a text.
                <b>row</b> is the index of the line,
                <b>column</b> is the index of the next character from the caret in the current paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the caret is at the end of a line,
                <b>column</b> equals to the total character number of the line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text editor controls only support left-to-right languages,
                the "next character" is the character at the right side of the caret.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>CaretBegin</b> and <b>CaretEnd</b> properties
                represent the range of the selection.
                If the mouse dragging from right to left on a piece of text in a left-to-right language,
                <b>CaretBegin</b> is larger than <b>CaretEnd</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>CaretSmall</b> property returns whatever is closer to the beginning in <b>CaretBegin</b> and <b>CaretEnd</b>.
                The <b>CaretLarge</b> property returns the one closer to the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SetCaret</b> changes <b>CaretBegin</b> and <b>CaretEnd</b> at the same time.
                To cancel the selection and move the caret,
                just set these two properties to the same value.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>CalculateCaretFromPoint</b> returns the nearest caret at a position.
                The coordinate is the left-top corner of the text.
