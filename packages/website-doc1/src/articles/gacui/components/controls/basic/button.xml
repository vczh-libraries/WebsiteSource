                <p>
                    The default value for this property is <b>true</b>,
                    but it could be different in sub classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When mouse operations happen in child controls which are contained in a button,
                    the button ignores these operations so that it behaves like not being clicked.
                    But once the <b>IgnoreChildControlMouseEvents</b> property is set to <b>false</b>,
                    this behavior changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property is very useful when adding child controls for visual effect only.
