        <title>Basic Controls</title>
        <p>
            Controls visualize data and react to user input.
            <b>&lt;Window/&gt;</b> is also a control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use <b>SafeDeleteControl</b> and <b>SafeDeleteComposition</b>
            to delete a control or a composition containing controls.
            Otherwise memory leaks may happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            A control has three main composition properties:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>BoundsComposition</b>:
                    This is a composition of the control's border.
                    To make a control appear inside another composition,
                    just simply adds <b>BoundsComposition</b> as a child composition to that composition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ContainerComposition</b>:
                    This is a composition of the control's inner border.
                    To make another composition inside a control,
                    just simply adds that composition as a child composition to <b>ContainerComposition</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>FocusComposition</b>:
                    If a control is focusable,
                    this property returns a non-null value.
                    <b>FocusComposition</b> receives <a href="/gacui/components/compositions/events.html">most of composition events</a>.
                    Ideally,
                    events provided by the control itself is sufficient enough,
                    <b>FocusComposition</b> is designed for the implementation of the control and the control template.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>BoundsComposition</b> and <b>ContainerComposition</b> will not change during a control's life time.
            <b>FocusComposition</b> changes when the control template changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many properties are shared across control classes.

                <p>
                    When a control's <b>Enabled</b> is set to <b>false</b>,
                    <b>VisuallyEnalbed</b> of the control itself and all direct or indirect child controls is also set to <b>false</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A visually disabled control doesn't react to user input.

                <p>
                    The default value for this property is <b>true</b>.

                    When a control's <b>Enabled</b> is set to <b>false</b>,

                    the control disappears,
                    but it still affect the minimum size of all parent compositions.

            <title>Control Template</title>
            <p>
                The following properties and events control the control template for a control.
            </p>
            <topic>
                <title>ControlThemeName (ControlThemeNameChanged)</title>
                <p>
                    A <b>ThemeTemplates</b> contains control template implementations for controls.
                    Each control template factory fields are optional.
                    Multiple <b>ThemeTemplates</b> could be registered and unregistered using <b>RegisterTheme</b> and <b>UnregisteredTheme</b>.
                    The later registered <b>ThemeTemplates</b> has a higher pririty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When calling <b>GetCurrentTheme-&gt;CreateStyle(themeName)</b>,
                    it goes through all registered theme and find if any <b>ThemeTemplates</b> has an implementation for the specified <b>themeName</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>ControlThemeName</b> property specifies which control template should be used for this template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different control classes have different default values for this property.
                    In most of the cases this property is not expected to be changed during the runtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When <b>ControlThemeName</b> is changed and <b>ControlTemplate</b> is empty,
                    the control template for this control will be changed immediately.
                    <b>SetControlThemeNameAndTemplate</b> is for changing both <b>ControlThemeName</b> and <b>ControlTemplate</b> at the same time to improve the performance.

                <title>ControlTemplate (ControlTemplateChanged)</title>
                <p>
                    This property is used when you doesn't want the registered control template for this control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default value for this property is empty.
                    The value for this property must be a <b>vl::Func</b> for the function type <b>templates::GuiControlTemplate*(const reflection::description::Value&amp;)</b>.
                </p>

                    When <b>ControlTemplate</b> is assigned with an empty value,
                    <b>ControlThemeName</b> kicks in and update the control template for this control.
                    When <b>ControlTemplate</b> is assigned with a non-empty value,
                    this property is evaluated to create a control template for this control.
                    <b>SetControlThemeNameAndTemplate</b> is for changing both <b>ControlThemeName</b> and <b>ControlTemplate</b> at the same time to improve the performance.

                <p>
                    This property returns the currently used control template instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A control template is also a composition,
                    and it has <b>BoundsComposition</b> and <b>ContainerComposition</b> too.
                    But they are not same values as the same property of the control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>FocusComposition</b> is the same to control and control templates.

                <title>Parent (ControlSignalTrigerred)</title>
                <p>
                    A control appears inside its <b>Parent</b>,
                    otherwise this property returns <b>null</b> (usually for windows and menus).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add a control directly inside another control,
                    just simply call <b>AddChild</b>, which adds the child control's <b>BoundsComposition</b> to the parent control's <b>ContainerComposition</b>.
                    It is also OK when the child control's <b>BoundsComposition</b> is not the direct child composition of the parent control's <b>ContainerComposition</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>GetChildrenCount</b>, <b>GetChild</b> and <b>HasChild</b>
                    provide access for child controls.

                    <b>RelatedControlHost</b> is the root parent control for a control,
                    which is usually a window or a menu.
                    otherwise this property returns <b>null</b> (usually for windows and menus).

                <p>
                    The default value for this property <b>true</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this property is set to <b>true</b>,
                    pressing <b>TAB</b> key when this control is focused type a <b>TAB</b> character into this control.

                <p>
                    The default value for this property is <b>-1</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressing <b>TAB</b> in a window cause the focus to move between all controls that have a non-negative value <b>TabProperty</b> from low to high.
                </p>
            </topic>
            <topic>
                <title>Alt (AltChanged)</title>
                <p>
                    The default value for this property is <b>&quot;&quot;</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressing <b>ALT</b> causes a window prints all acceptable keys to move focus to all controls that have a non-empty <b>Alt</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Alt</b> could contain multiple upper-cased letters and digits,
                    which is a sequence that moves the focus to this control after pressing <b>ALT</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For controls that are not focusable but manage focus of direct child controls (like Tab control),
                    or for controls that manage focus of child controls in another window (like menus),
                    <b>SetActivatingAltHost</b> is an important function to activate this feature for this control.
                    This function is only for control authors to use.
