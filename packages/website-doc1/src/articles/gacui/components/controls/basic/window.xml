        <p>
            <b>&lt;Window/&gt;</b> is where we start our journey.
            <program>
                <code><![CDATA[
                    <Instance ref.CodeBehind="false" ref.Class="demo::MainWindow>

                      </Window>
                    </Instance>
                ]]></code>
            </program>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;Window/&gt;</b> is a <b>ControlHost</b>,
                    which has to be a top-level window,
                    is usually a base class of an
                    <a href="/gacui/xmlres/tag_instance.html">
                        &lt;Instance&gt;
                    </a>.
                    Here we create a class <b>demo::MainWindow</b> inheriting from <b>&lt;Window/&gt;</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ref.CodeBehind</b> set to <b>false</b>
                    so that GacUI doesn't generate a separated pair of C++ source files for this class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Text</b> is the title of this window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ClientSize</b> is the initial size when the window is loaded.
                    This size doesn't include the border and the title.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>BoundsComposition.PreferredMinSize</b> is the minimum client size of this window.
                    When the window size is being changed by dragging the border,
                    it cannot go smaller than this size.
                </li>
