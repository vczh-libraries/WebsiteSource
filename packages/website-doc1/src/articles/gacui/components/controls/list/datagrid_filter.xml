        <title>Filter</title>
        <p>
            A filter is an instance of interface <b>list::IDataFilter</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a filter is installed to the data grid,
            <b>SetCallback</b> will be called.
            <b>GetItemProvider</b> in the callback object provides access to the <b>ItemProvider</b> of the data grid.
            <b>OnProcessorChanged</b> in the callback object is called by the filter,
            when the filter definition is changed
            (e.g. a the date range is changed in a filter that only allow items in that range).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Filter</b> function accepts an item from <b>ItemSource</b>,
            it returns <b>true</b> when the item satisfies the filter.

            <p>
                Typically you need to implement the interface directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a filter is semantically for a column,
                a filter could be implemented by a column dropdown.
                Usually this is done by creating a <b>&lt;CustomControl/&gt;</b> or a <b>&lt;Popup/&gt;</b>
                for the UI in the column dropdown.
                The control has a <b>list::IDataFilter</b> property,
                whose the implementation talks to the control for filter arguments.
                In the end,
                install the filter to both <b>Filter</b> and <b>Popup</b> in <b>list::DataColumn</b>.
            </p>

                <b>list::DataAndFilter</b>:
                Combine multiple filters to one filter.
                An item satisfies this filter when it satisfies all sub filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>list::DataOrFilter</b>:
                Combine multiple filters to one filter.
                An item satisfies this filter when it satisfies at least one sub filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>list::DataNotFilter</b>:
                Convert one filter to another.
                An item satisfies this filter when it unsatisfies the sub filter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Multiple filters could be assigned to each column.
                A filter could be assigned to the control using the <b>AdditionalFilter</b> property.
                An item must satisfies <b>AdditionalFilter</b> add every filter assigned to columns
                in order to appear in the control.
