        <title>Responsive Design Series</title>
        <p>
            Responsive design compositions consist of following compositions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>:
                    A composition that tells its <b>ResponsiveTarget</b> to switch to a different view when the size of the &lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt; is changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b>:
                    A composition that manages multiple views in order from large to small,
                    it has following sub classes for different way of management:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b>:
                            only has one level of view.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b>:
                            allow manually assigned views:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Views</b> accepts multiple <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> in order from large to small as its levels of views.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>SharedControls</b> accepts multiple controls.
                                    When switching views,
                                    a <b>&lt;ResponsiveShared/&gt;</b> could move a referenced shared control from one view to another,
                                    keeping all its status (especially for editable controls).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b>:
                            the number of its levels of views equals to one direct or indirect child <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b>
                            that has the most levels of views.
                            When it needs to switch to another view,
                            it tells all direct or indirect child <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> to synchronize to the same level of view.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>&lt;ResponsiveStack/&gt;</b>:
                            the number of its levels of views equals to the sum of levels of views in all direct or indirect child <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b>.
                            When it needs to switch to another view,
                            it tells one indirect child <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> to switch view,
                            unless all has switched to its largest or the smallest views.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Usually, a <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b> is put inside a window and configured to change its size according to the window size.
            And then use <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;ResponsiveStack/&gt;</b> together
            to control how controls are reorganized to fit in different sizes of the container.
            finally this <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> tree will be assigned to <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>::<b>ResponsiveTarget</b>
            to make the reorganizing automatically happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically,
            <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> will only be put in <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>::<b>Views</b>
            when this level of view doesn't have sub levels of views.

            <title>A responsive layout sample</title>
            <p>
                For example,
                in
                <a href="https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/tree/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Layout/Responsive2">
                    this sample
                </a>:
                <img src="/gacui/kb_compositions_responsive_2.gif"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three level of views:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>View 1</b>: Buttons with icons and titles on the left side, and video icons on the right side.</li>
                    <li><b>View 2</b>: Buttons with icons on the left side, and video icons on the right side.</li>
                    <li><b>View 3</b>: Buttons in a menu on the top side, and video icons on the bottom side.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>View 1</b> is larger than <b>View 2</b> because titles of buttons are hidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>View 2</b> is larger than <b>View 3</b> because buttons are hidden.
                Although the menu of <b>View 3</b> increases the height,
                but video icons are scrollable,
                the list control could shrink vertically to make spaces for the menu.
            </p>

            <title>A basic idea to implement this sample</title>
            <p>
                We will easily find that,
                the difference between <b>View 1</b> and <b>View 2</b> is button titles.
                so the button template itself could be a <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b> which has two <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> in its <b>Views</b> property:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first (larger) view contains one icon and one title</li>
                    <li>The second (smaller) view contains only one icon</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now the button becomes responsive,
                you don't need to create two different view for <b>View 1</b> and <b>View 2</b> in <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b>,
                which is wasting memories and reducing performance.
                Instead,
                you could use a <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b> to contain these buttons.
                Since all buttons have 2 levels of views,
                so <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b> has 2 levels of views,
                because all child <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> will synchronize to the same level of view.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now <b>View 1</b> and <b>View 2</b> are represented in one <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b>,
                we have to create a <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b> to contain <b>&lt;ResponsiveGroup/&gt;</b> and <b>View 3</b> as its two views.
            </p>
            <p>
                The list control for video icons could be registered in <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b>::<b>SharedControls</b>.
                When the application switches between views,
                the list control will be moved to different view,
                controlled by all <b>&lt;ResponsiveShared/&gt;</b> in each views.
