            <b>&lt;Bounds/&gt;</b> is able to set a relative position directly.
            But usually this composition is used when you just need to have a composition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three properties are provided by <b>&lt;Bounds/&gt;</b>:

            <title>SizeAffectParent</title>
            <p>
                The default value of <b>SizeAffectParent</b> is <b>true</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it is <b>true</b>,

            <title>Bounds</title>
            <p>
                To set a relative position,
                the default value is 0 for all its components.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT</b>:
                The relative position of a composition does not always listen to the value of <b>Bounds</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Bounds</b> is only a suggestion.
                To decide a position of a composition,
                one component will be calculated by looking at other properties,
                only when nothing is provided for this component,
                the component of <b>Bounds</b> will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example,
                to decide the width of a composition,
                <b>AlignmentToParent</b> will first be examined.
                But sometimes <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> are both -1 in <b>AlignmentToParent</b>,
                and there is enough room for the composition to grow bigger than its minimum width,
                then <b>width</b> of <b>Bounds</b> is used.
            </p>

            <title>AlignmentToParent</title>
            <p>
                <b>AlignmentToParent</b> is added for all compositions that can control the relative position by themselves.
                The position of <b>&lt;StackItem/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;FlowItem/&gt;</b> are completely decided by
                <b>&lt;Stack/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Flow/&gt;</b>,
                <b>AlignmentToParent</b> does not exist in these compositions.
