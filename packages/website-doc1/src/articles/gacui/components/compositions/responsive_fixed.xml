            <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> only has one view.
            If there are some <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> added as child compositions in <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b>,
            they are ignored and their views will not change.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> is a <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> and a <b>&lt;Bounds/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to just add a static view to <b>&lt;ResponsiveView/&gt;</b>::<b>View</b>,
            but <b>Views</b> requires <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b>.
            <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> is designed for this scenario.

                Since <b>&lt;ResponsiveFixed/&gt;</b> only has one view,
                this property is ignored.
