                When a <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> is assigned to <b>ResponsiveTarget</b>,
                it is also added as a child composition in &lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;,
                with its <b>AlignmentToParent</b> set to <b>left:0 top:0 right:0 bottom:0</b>,
                and it switches to the largest view that could fit in the <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a <b>GuiResponsiveCompositionBase</b> is removed from <b>ResponsiveTarget</b>,
                it is also removed from &lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;.

            <p>
                When a <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b> becomes larger,
                it will try to tell its <b>ResponsiveTarget</b> to switch to a largest view
                that could fit in the <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>.
                If the current view is the largest view,
                or the next larger view could not fit in the <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b>,
                it stays with the current view.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b> becomes smaller,
                it does the same but try to switch to a smaller view.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the size of <b>&lt;ResponsiveContainer/&gt;</b> is decided by the window size,
                when the window is being resized,
                it takes effect only when the mouse is released.
                It doesn't change view when the mouse is still dragging.
