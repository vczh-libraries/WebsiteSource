                If you don't need runtime reflection on C++ classes,
                it is recommended to add <b>VCZH_DEBUG_NO_REFLECTION</b> to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions">preprocessor definitions</a>.
                By doing this, unnecessary code are eliminated, which significantly reduces both executable size and object sizes.

                    They are needed for executing compiled binaries from Workflow script.

                    There are 2 ways to run Workflow script:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate C++ code from Workflow script, and add them to your project. This is recommended especially for running GacUI applications.</li>
                        <li>Load compiled binaries from Workflow script and run on-the-fly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are needed for compiling Workflow script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no IO or other data exchange functionalities in predefined libraries.
                    In order to make Workflow script works,
                    usually you need to provide your own API to your script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, this is done by writing reflectable C++ class,
                    loading type information and then running the compiler in the same process.
                    And then you get a binary from compiled scripts,
                    all classes defined in scripts are accessible.
                    You can use VlppReflection to run classes in scripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Workflow compiler can also generate C++ code.
                    Using generated C++ code directly is always highly recommended when possible.
