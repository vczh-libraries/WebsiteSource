            <title>Using return</title>
            <p>
                <b>return EXPR;</b> stops a <b>$Async</b> coroutine and generates a return value.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is a <b>static func StoreResult</b> in the return type of the function,
                the return value becomes <b>TYPE::StoreResult(EXPR)</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this <b>$Async</b> does not have a meaningful return value,
                like when the coroutine function returns <b>void</b> or <b>system::Async^</b>,
                it should return <b>null</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since a function exists without a <b>return</b> statement also returns <b>null</b>,
                so the <b>return</b> statement is not always necessary.
            </p>

            <title>Using the $ expression</title>
            <p>
                The <b>$</b> expression in a <b>$Async</b> coroutine returns <b>system::AsyncContext^</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When an <b>system::Async^</b> is executed outside from a <b>$Async</b> coroutine,
                an <b>system::AsyncContext^</b> is required to be passed to the <b>Async::Execute</b> method.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could be null, which is also the default value for this parameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>$Await</b> will pass this <b>system::AsyncContext^</b> object to all nested <b>system::Async^</b> values.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>$</b> expression returns this particular <b>system::AsyncContext^</b> object,
                which has two members:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>func Cancel(): bool</b>, makes <b>$.IsCancelled()</b> returns <b>true</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>func IsCancelled(): bool</b> is designed to be called in any <b>$Async</b> coroutine.
                        If a <b>$Async</b> coroutine has many steps,
                        it could check <b>$.IsCancelled()</b> frequently and stops the coroutine when it is required.
                        This does not happen automatically,
                        a <b>$Async</b> can ignore <b>$.IsCancelled()</b>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <title>Executing system::Async^</title>
            <p>
                <b>system::Async::Delay</b> function creates a task that ends after a specific period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>system::Async::Execute</b> executes an task in a background thread.
                The first argument is a callback that will be triggered when the task is end.
                The second argument is an optional object that becomes <b>$</b> in a <b>$Async</b> coroutine.
            </p>
            <p>
                If <b>system::Async::Execute</b> is not called for the first time for that particular object,
                it fails and returns <b>false</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling a <b>$Async</b> function which returning <b>void</b>,
                result in starting the task immediately.

            <p>
                Calling <b>system::AsyncScheduler::RegisterDefaultScheduler</b> or
                <b>system::AsyncScheduler::RegisterSchedulerForCurrentThread</b>
                are required before executing a task in a particular thread.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are recommended to call
                <b>system::AsyncScheduler::UnregisterDefaultScheduler</b> or
                <b>system::AsyncScheduler::UnregisterSchedulerForCurrentThread</b>
                when no task is needed to run in a particular thread.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>system::Async::Execute</b> use the caller thread's scheduler to run itself.
                If <b>RegisterSchedulerForCurrentThread</b> is called for this thread,
                it will not use the scheduler that is registered by <b>RegisterDefaultScheduler</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually this interface is implemented in C++,
                which should use <b>vl::reflection::description::IAsyncScheduler</b> as the name of the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 methods that need to be implemented:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Execute</b>:
                            This function runs a callback in any thread it likes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This function is called after <b>$Await</b> finishes waiting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For GacUI, the scheduler for the UI thread is different from other thread,
                            because <b>Execute</b> of the UI thread's scheduler runs callbacks in the UI thread.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that,
                            for any <b>$Async</b> that is called from the UI thread,
                            all code will eventually be executed in the UI thread,
                            including tasks that are awaited using <b>$Await</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a task don't want to be executed in the UI thread even when it is scheculed by the UI thread,
                            it needs to explicitly call <b>AsyncScheduler::ExecuteInBackground</b>,
                            which means thiat task cannot be implemented using coroutine.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>ExecuteInBackground</b>:
                            This function runs a callback in any thread it likes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It will not be called by generated code from <b>$Async</b> coroutines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For GacUI, <b>ExecuteInBackground</b> runs callbacks in a random non-UI thread.
                            It doesn't matter whether this scheduler is for the UI thread or not.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>DelayExecute</b>:
                            This function runs a callback in any thread it likes
                            after a specified period of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It will not be called by generated code from <b>$Async</b> coroutines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For GacUI, the scheduler for the UI thread is different from other thread,
                            because <b>DelayExecute</b> of the UI thread's scheduler runs callbacks in the UI thread.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT</b>:
                There is no default scheduler provided by Workflow script.
                If you don't implement any scheduler,
                <b>$Async</b> coroutine fails.
