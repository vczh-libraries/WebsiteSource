                    <b>&lt;RibbonSplitter/&gt;</b>

            <b>&lt;RibbonSplitter/&gt;</b> splits controls in <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example,
            <b>&lt;RibbonButtons/&gt;</b> groups every three buttons together,
            but there is no splitter between buttons.
            In order to create a visible splitter in a <b>&lt;RibbonButtons/&gt;</b> of six buttons,
            a <b>&lt;RibbonSplitter/&gt;</b> is put between two <b>&lt;RibbonButtons/&gt;</b>,
            each having three buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a button never changes into smaller size,
            <b>&lt;RibbonLargeButton/&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;RibbonLargeDropdownButton/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;RibbonLargeSplitButton/&gt;</b>
            are recommended to put in <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b> directly,
            instead of putting multiple <b>&lt;ToolstripButton/&gt;</b> in one <b>&lt;RibbonButtons/&gt;</b>,
            having both <b>MaxSize</b> and <b>MinSizee</b> set to <b>Large</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically,
            <b>&lt;RibbonSplitters/&gt;</b> is designed for split buttons,
            since <b>&lt;RibbonToolstrips/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;BindableRibbonGalleryList/&gt;</b> are recommended
            to have exclusive <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b> for each of them.
