        <title>Container Controls</title>
        <p>
            Unlike compositions that only layout multiple other objects in groups,
            container controls offer more features in user interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;GroupBox/&gt;</b> is the simplest container composition
            which displays its <b>Text</b> with its content.
            Controls serving a same purpose could be grouped
            in a <b>&lt;GroupBox/&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;ScrollContainer/&gt;</b> is a container with built-in scroll bars.
            When the size of the container is too small to display all its content,
            scroll bars will be enabled or shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scroll bars are provided in <b>GuiScrollView</b>,
            which is the base class of <b>&lt;ScrollContainer/&gt;</b>
            and also all other list controls and some editor controls.
            <b>HorizontalAlwaysVisible</b> and <b>VerticalAlwaysVisible</b> properties
            also exist in list controls and some editor controls,
            so that their scroll bars can be optionally hidden
            when list items are not too many.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>&lt;Tab/&gt;</b> is a container of multiple <b>&lt;TabPage/&gt;</b>.
            Differet controls can be organized in different <b>&lt;TabPage/&gt;</b> in one <b>&lt;Tab/&gt;</b>.
            When a <b>&lt;TabPage/&gt;</b> is activated by the user,
            only contents in this page are visible,
            contents in other pages are hidden but still contribute to the minimum size of the <b>&lt;Tab/&gt;</b>.
