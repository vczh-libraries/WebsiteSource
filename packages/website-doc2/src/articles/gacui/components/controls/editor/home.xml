                <b>GuiDocumentCommonInterface</b> is the base class of all editor controls mentioned in this page.
                This class offers all available rendering and editing features for documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sub classes of <b>GuiDocumentCommonInterface</b> implements different rendering and editing behaviors by offering different default controls via <b>GuiDocumentConfig</b>.
                These default values could be found in <b>GuiDocumentConfig</b>'s static methods:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>GetDocumentLabelDefaultConfig()</b></li>
                    <li><b>GetDocumentViewerDefaultConfig()</b></li>

            <title>Document Controls (default behavior)</title>
            <p>
                Document controls are designed to display documents.
                It supports all kinds of Unicode-definded languages and characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                A document could be rich formatted:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Text and Images are organized in multiple paragraphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each paragraph has its own alignment option.
                        multiple <b>CRLF</b> characters supported in a paragrpah.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Different parts of text could be in different sizes, fonts and colors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Controls and compositions could be embedded into a document.
                        This feature could be used to create a static table,
                        a interactive list view
                        or even a submittable form with verifiable inputs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 document controls in GacUI:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>&lt;DocumentViewer/&gt;</b></li>
                    <li><b>&lt;DocumentTextBox/&gt;</b></li>

            <p>
                Text controls are designed to display plain text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text control doesn't support rich format:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each line forms a paragraph.
                        Multiple lines of text are separated by <b>CRLF</b> characters.
                        You can insert <b>LF</b> but it will be converted to <b>CRLF</b> immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All characters are in the same size and font but different colors.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <title>Caret Position</title>
            <p>
                <b>(vl::)presentation::TextPos</b> struct represents a caret position in a document.
                <b>row</b> is the index of the paragraph,
                <b>column</b> is the index of the next character from the caret in the current paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the caret is at the end of a paragraph,
                <b>column</b> equals to the total character number of the paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                For left-to-right languages,
                the "next character" is the character at the right side of the caret.
            </p>
            <p>
                For non-character objects,
                each of them count as one character.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>CaretBegin</b> and <b>CaretEnd</b> properties
                represent the range of the selection.
                If the mouse dragging from right to left on a piece of text in a left-to-right language,
                <b>CaretBegin</b> is larger than <b>CaretEnd</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SetCaret</b> changes <b>CaretBegin</b> and <b>CaretEnd</b> at the same time.
                To cancel the selection and move the caret,
                just set these two properties to the same value.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>CalculateCaretFromPoint</b> returns the nearest caret at a position.
                The coordinate origin is the left-top corner of the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>GetCaretBounds</b> returns the position of a caret.
                It is a rectangle with <b>zero</b> width,
                the <b>y1</b> and <b>y2</b> components represent the position of the vertical caret line.

                The <b>SelectionText</b> and <b>SelectionModel</b> properties
                return the selection of the document as pure text or document fragment.
                Assigning them behaves as calling <b>EditRun</b> and <b>EditText</b>
                on the selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SelectAll</b> set the selection to the whole document.

            <p>
                <b>LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo</b> or <b>LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo</b> are recommended to initialize or reset editor controls with desired content.
                These function load new content to the control with optimized performance and clear all undo and redo history.

            <title>Assigning Document and Document Items</title>
            <p>
                Assign a <b>(vl::)presentation::DocumentModel</b> to the <b>Document</b> property
                updates the whole content in the control
                and move the caret to the beginning of the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                For any document item placeholder in an document like:
                <program>
                    <code><![CDATA[
                      <object name="SOMETHING"/>
                    ]]></code>
                </program>
                A <b>&lt;DocumentItem/&gt;</b> with exactly the same name
                in any document editor controls
                embeds anything in this tag to the document at the placeholder:
                <program>
                    <code><![CDATA[
                      <DocumentViewer>
                        <DocumentItem Name="SOMETHING">
                          <Button Text="SOMETHING"/>
                        </DocumentItem>
                      </DocumentViewer>
                    ]]></code>
                </program>
                Only one composition or one control could be the direct child tag in <b>&lt;DocumentItem/&gt;</b>,
                but it could have any number of child compositions or controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                The size of the placeholder is the minimum size of the composition or the control.
                There could be multiple <b>&lt;DocumentItem/&gt;</b> in a document editor control.
                If any <b>&lt;object/&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;DocumentItem/&gt;</b> fails to match each other,
                it is ignored,
                but the <b>&lt;object/&gt;</b> still take a caret position of one character.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>AddDocumentItem</b>, <b>RemoveDocumentItem</b> and <b>GetDocumentItems</b>
                can be used before and after assigning a document to the <b>Document</b> property.

                All <b>Edit*</b> methods takes two carets and the content
                and replace the specified range of the current document with the specified content.
                If the two carets are the same value,
                they insert instead of replace.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>EditRun</b> insert or replace with a <b>(vl::)presentation::DocumentMode</b> object.
                If the <b>copy</b> argument is set to <b>true</b>,
                sub nodes will not be reused.
            </p>
            <p>
                If sub nodes in <b>Document</b> is changed without calling any <b>Edit*</b> method,
                <b>NotifyParagraphUpdated(index, oldCount, newCount)</b> and <b>ClearUndoRedo</b> must be called,
                which means paragraphcs from <b>index</b>-th to <b>index+oldCount-1</b>-th
                has been replaced by <b>newCount</b> paragraphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously,
                if all changes happen in one paragraph,
                arguments <b>NotifyParagraphUpdated(index, 1, 1)</b> are expected.

                    <b>SetParagraphAlignments</b> updates alignments on multiple paragraphs with different values at the same time.
                    <b>SetParagraphAlignment</b> updates alignments on multiple paragraphs with a same value.
                    Since alignment is an attribute of paragraph instead of characters,
                    the specified range of the document doesn't need to be whole paragraphs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>SummarizeParagraphAlignment</b>
                    checks if all paragraphs in the specified range of the document
                    have the same alignment configuration.
                    <b>null</b> is returned when they are not,
                    otherwise the alignment value will be returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Valid values for alignment is <b>Left</b> (default), <b>Right</b> and <b>Center</b>.
                    <b>Top</b> and <b>Bottom</b> are not used here,
                    using them results in undefined behavior.

            <p>
                <b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b> and <b>Paste</b> apply on selections.
                Only non-empty selection could be <b>Cut</b> or <b>Copy</b>.
                Calling <b>Paste</b> with a non-empty selection replaces the selection with the content from the clipboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>CanPaste</b> also checks the content from the clipboard and see if it is a valid document fragment.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a piece of document is cut or copied,
                following formats are written to the clipboard:
                <ul>
                    <li>The private format of GacUI document.</li>
                    <li>RTF.</li>
                    <li>HTML.</li>
                    <li>Plain text representation of the document. In Windows, both ANSI and UNICODE formats are available.</li>
                    <li>If exactly one image is selected, the image is also copied to the clipboard.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Acceptable content from the clipboard is:
                <ul>
                    <li>The private format of GacUI document.</li>
                    <li>Plain text. In Windows, both ANSI and UNICODE formats are acceptable.</li>
                    <li>If exactly one image is selected, the image is also copied to the clipboard.</li>

            <p>
                Return values from <b>CanUndo</b> and <b>CanRedo</b>
                indicates whether <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> will be successful or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT</b>:
                Changing sub nodes in <b>Document</b> will mess up undo and redo,
                so <b>ClearUndoRedo</b> is always necessary after <b>NotifyParagraphUpdated</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                All other operations,
                including keyboard operations and all editing methods mentioned above,
                will be recorded and are all undo-able and redo-able.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NotifyParagraphUpdated</b> marks the current version as "saved" and clear the previous mark.
                <b>GetModified</b> returns true when the current version is marked as "saved".
                Only one version will be marked as "saved".
