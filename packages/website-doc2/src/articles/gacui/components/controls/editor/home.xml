            <title>Document Controls</title>
            <p>
                Document controls are designed to display documents.
                It supports all kinds of Unicode-definded languages and characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                A document could be rich formatted:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Text and Images are organized in multiple paragraphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each paragraph has its own alignment option.
                        multiple <b>CRLF</b> characters supported in a paragrpah.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Different parts of text could be in different sizes, fonts and colors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Controls and compositions could be embedded into a document.
                        This feature could be used to create a static table,
                        a interactive list view
                        or even a submittable form with verifiable inputs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 document controls in GacUI:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>&lt;DocumentViewer/&gt;</b></li>
                    <li><b>&lt;DocumentTextBox/&gt;</b></li>
                    <li><b>&lt;DocumentLabel/&gt;</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <title>Text Controls</title>
            <p>
                Text controls are designed to display programming languages.
                It renders UCS-2 or UTF-16 code points
                (depending on the size of <b>wchar_t</b> in your compiler)
                independenly in a simple left-to-right layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text control doesn't support rich format:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Only characters are supported.
                        Images, controls or compositions cannot be embedded into characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no paragraph.
                        Multiple lines of text are separated by <b>CRLF</b> characters.
                        You can insert <b>LF</b> but it will be converted to <b>CRLF</b> immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All characters are in the same size and font but different colors.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 2 text controls in GacUI:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>&lt;SinglelineTextBox/&gt;</b></li>
                    <li><b>&lt;MultilineTextBox/&gt;</b></li>
                </ul>

                <title>Colorization</title>
                <p>
                    Colorization is enabled only in text controls.
                    Text could be colorized by multiple regular expressions or totally by code.
                    Additional Context sensitive colorizing could be implemented by code
                    on top of regular expressions.

                <title>Auto Complete</title>
                <p>
                    Auto complete is enabled only in text controls.
                    auto complete candidates could be dynamically provided during typing,
                    and text controls will handle the UI.

                <p>
                    Colorization and auto complete could be implemented using a grammar offered by <b>VlppParser</b>.
                    But a new <b>VlppParser2</b> is coming,
                    which supports code refactoring with a more powerful AST design.
