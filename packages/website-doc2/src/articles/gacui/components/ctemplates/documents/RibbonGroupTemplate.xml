  <introduction>
    <p>
      This control template is for <b>&lt;RibbonGroup/&gt;</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ribbon group could be collapsed when there is no enough space for all its contained objects.
      When the collapsing happens,
      contained objects will be removed from the container,
      and the toolstrip button will be put in it instead.
      The title bar below contained objects is expected to disappear,
      or there will be two group names rendered inside the control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>ContainerComposition</b> property must be set to contain objects,
      which are typically above of the title bar.

    <prop name="Commands">
      <p>
        The type of this property is <b>(vl::)presentation::controls::IRibbonGroupCommandExecutor*</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This property is set after this control template is applied to a control.
        It offers a way for this control template to communicate with the control.
      </p>
    </prop>

    <prop name="Expandable">
      <p>
        This property is set to <b>true</b> when the <b>Expandable</b> property of the control is set to <b>true</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a ribbon group is expandable,
        there should be a extend button,
        which is usually placed at the corner of the title bar.
        When it is clicked,
        the <b>NotifyExpandButtonClicked</b> method of <b>Commands</b> must be called.
      </p>
    </prop>

    <prop name="Collapsed">
      <p>
        This property is set to <b>true</b> when there is no enough space for the ribbon group.
        The ribbon group will become a button,
        and the control template will appear in the dropdown menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the ribbon group is collapsed,
        the title bar is expected to disappear.
        This is usually done by setting a row of the table to be zero height,
        when this row is specifically just for the title bar.
